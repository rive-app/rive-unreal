# Rive Unreal

An Unreal runtime library for [Rive](https://rive.app). This is currently a **technical preview** for Mac and Windows installs of Unreal. We're hoping to gather feedback about the API and feature-set as we expand platform support.

### Rendering support

Currently supported platforms and backends include:

- Metal on Mac
- Metal on iOS
- D3D11 on Windows
- OpenGL on Android

Planned support for:
 
- D3D12 on Windows
- Vulkan on Linux, Android, Windows

### Feature support

The rive-unreal runtime uses the latest Rive C++ runtime.

## Rive overview

[Rive](https://rive.app) is a real-time interactive design and animation tool that helps teams
create and run interactive animations anywhere. Designers and developers use our collaborative
editor to create motion graphics that respond to different states and user inputs. Our lightweight
open-source runtime libraries allow them to load their animations into apps, games, and websites.

## Getting started

Check out the latest example project from the [releases page](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/releases) to see a few techniques for adding Rive graphics in an Unreal project, as well as documentation on navigating the samples.

You can find the source for the rive-unreal-examples [here](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal-examples).

You will need to work in the **Unreal 5.3 or 5.4** editor that supports OpenGL or D3D11 for Windows, or a Mac with ARM64 (M1, M2, etc) architecture.

Select either D3D11/OpenGL for Windows, or Metal for Mac/iOS as the Renderer ID under Editor Preferences -> Plugins - Graphics Switching in Unreal. If you are making an Android Build, make sure to use OpenGL instead of Vulcan.

### Adding the Rive Unreal plugin

For this technical preview, you can add the Rive Unreal plugin to your existing Unreal projects by downloading the plugin from the Github Releases, and copy/pasting the Rive folder into your `Plugins/` folder of your project (or creating one). 

Then drag in a `.riv` file to your Unreal project to generate a new Widget Blueprint, Texture Object, and a Rive File definition.
